    <p>Our team is seeking a Web Application Designer/Developer who is passionate about rich mobile and desktop web experiences. As part of a growing team, you will be responsible for designing and developing web-based client applications using modern web tools and practices. We value collaborative team efforts.

    <p>Your first project will be part of a new product development effort, for which the architecture has not been entirely solidified. Therefore you will contribute to the decisions surrounding the tools and technologies that we choose.  That said, we would hope that you would have experience with a number of such technologies, so that we can make informed decisions.</p>

    <p>Responsibilities:
        <ul>
            <li>Work with a cross-functional product development team to design and develop web-based applications.</li>

            <li>Uphold a positive attitude while seeking solutions, sometimes creative ones, for challenges that often appear in web development.</li>
            <li>Innovate and create where there are gaps or opportunities in accepted practices or solutions.</li>
            <li>Test the products for overall application quality, stability and correctness as part of regular testing and validation efforts (both automated and manual).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Required qualifications for all applications include:
        <ul>
            <li>Post-secondary education in the form of a degree or diploma from an accredited institution, or equivalent experience. We love well-rounded people, so your education need not be specific to your role.</li>
            <li>2 - 5 years of experience of professional web development, preferably for public facing web sites using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap and JQuery, that integrate with dynamic server-side processes (REST or JSON-RPC).</li>
            <li>A portfolio that demonstrates a good eye for appealing web design and user experience, including flow, colours, fonts, layouts, effects and animations.</li>
            <li>Experience working within a team environment in a full-time role.</li>
            <li>Excellent communication skills, both oral and written.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with Windows, Apple OS X and Linux.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Additional qualifications that will benefit your application include:
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrated capabilities designing and developing responsive web applications for a variety of mobile and desktop web clients.</li>
            <li>Experience with one or more web application frameworks, such as React, Angular or a similar framework.</li>
            <li>Experience with modern client-side development life cycles and tools, including node, npm, nginx, mocha, chai, sinon, watchify, browserify, uglify or similar tools.</li>
            <li>Understanding of client side testing tools and practices for various aspects of web development, both automated and manual.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with version control software, specifically Git and GitHub.</li>
            <li>Graphics processing, manipulation and optimization for mobile and desktop applications.</li>
            <li>Any additional programming experience in client (.NET, Flash) or server side technologies (Java, Ruby, Python).</li>
            <li>Experience working within an agile or iterative development methodology, such as XP, Scrum or Lean/Kanban.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
